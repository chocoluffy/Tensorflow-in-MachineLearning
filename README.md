# Tensorflow-in-MachineLearning
a repo dedicated to show examples and tutorials on how to apply tensorflow codes in machine learning area.

### How we use Tensorflow on my own mac ###
I recommend using virtualenv with pip package maneger, in order to avoid issues like conflicting python versions and the like. You know 
it's really frustrating to when you get started but found being trapped in version conflicts. Then you can make up your mind to follow the tutorials
from Tensorflow website.

### How to apply tensorflow into my machine learning code ###
You may want to first browse the tutorial page on Tensorflow website, where it hosts a detailed instructions of how we could get hand-in experience on 
using tensorflow on our real code!! 

### What about this repo ###
I create this repo for my own personal learning purpose, of course, I would like to share what I think is distilled and good tutorial tricks from official one. 
If you find out some better illustration, please send me a pull request, I would like to make it more complete and instructive. Thanks.
